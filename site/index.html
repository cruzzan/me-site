                <h4>About me</h4>
                <p>
                    Growing up in the Swedish countryside not too far from Gothenburg, I developed an instinct for
                    tinkering and problem-solving early on. Building tree houses and helping my parents with farmwork
                    and upkeep made it central to everyday life. A three-year stint in Melbourne during my teens shaped
                    me in ways that still show up at work: an ease with new people, new contexts, and an English that
                    has never felt like a second language.
                </p>
                <h5>My start</h5>
                <p>
                    I was building things well before I knew what I was doing. When my cousin brought me in to work
                    with him in 2011, I jumped at the chance. Not because I had a plan, but because I wanted to be
                    in the thick of it. Getting things working. Learning from what broke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That period taught me something that has stayed with me ever since: the difference between hacking
                    something together and actually understanding what you've built. I could make things work, but I
                    struggled to reason about why. And that gap bothered me enough to go back to school for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a pattern I keep returning to. Not just solving the problem in front of me, but understanding
                    the system well enough to see what the next one will be.
                </p>
                <h5>What I value</h5>
                <p>
                    The work I find most satisfying is when I can trace a problem from the customer's pain all the
                    way through to the code that solves it. Not just implementing a spec, but understanding why it
                    matters and what a good outcome actually looks like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have seen what happens when engineers are kept at arm's length from the product context. The
                    solutions tend to be technically correct and practically wrong. The engineers who make the biggest
                    impact are the ones who are curious about the whole system, including the parts they are not
                    directly responsible for. That curiosity is what lets you catch problems early and make decisions
                    that age well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do my best work in smaller teams where that kind of ownership is possible: building something,
                    watching it land with real users, and knowing whether it actually worked.
                </p>
                <h5>Outside of work</h5>
                <p>
                    Away from the keyboard, I run, cook, play golf, and ski. The thing I spend the most time on, though,
                    is renovations and hands-on building. In my own home and for friends and family, usually more
                    ambitious than it should be. But it scratches the same itch as programming: scoping out a problem,
                    working through the ones you did not anticipate, and ending up with something tangible.
                </p>
                <h5>Contact</h5>
                <p>

                    connect, feel free to reach out by email or on LinkedIn.

                            <p>
                                When I joined, Sendify was at an inflection point. The platform had been built quickly,
                                and the tech had kept pace with that, fast and pragmatic. A pair of major rebuilds were
                                being finished as I arrived: a full replacement of the invoicing system, and bringing the
                                pricing and product compatibility logic in-house, after years of outsourcing it. Our
                                efforts were focused on getting those initiatives across the line while managing any
                                other issues from earlier technical choices that the business had simply outgrown. All
                                of this while growth and new development had slowed below where we wanted it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My early work involved assisting the leading engineers on the project of in-housing the
                                pricing engine. This mainly meant making changes and improvements to carrier
                                integrations so that our existing catalog of carriers became compatible, one by one.
                                This helped me gain a deep understanding of how the system worked, and how complicated
                                our role in the supply chain is. And how hard it is to get a product set up
                                with high accuracy. Not to mention keeping it accurate with continuous pricing and
                                policy changes from the carriers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These factors of uncertainty made it difficult for us to balance our own exposure to
                                risk with our reliability towards our customers. Which I found to be a very interesting
                                area of improvement, so I led the subteam focusing on this area. We built tooling to
                                preview any updates to orders as they were being prepared to be invoiced, allowing us to
                                catch problems early. Then we added custom-rules based analysis to help figure out what
                                was causing the updates. And eventually automating corrections to address any known
                                issues without intervention. These efforts cut invoicing tickets in half, and reduced
                                the rate of customer churn attributed to invoicing issues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also led a project to open up a segment of customers we had previously been unable to
                                serve due to high credit risk. The solution was a direct payment flow at the point of
                                booking, which was new territory for us, since the platform had always been invoice-only.
                                The driver was clear: we were losing roughly 20% of new organic growth in the German
                                market to low or incomplete credit scores. Initial live testing showed that we could
                                convert roughly half of those previously blocked customers into active weekly shippers.
                            </p>

                                When I joined the team the application was a Php based
                                page with a login, and a form that spit out a code
                                representing the evaluation result of a player, along with
                                a design mockup of how the system was envisioned to work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Starting out on that foundation, work began with setting
                                up the existing application to look like the mockup.
                                After that came more features to support the coaches.
                                Player profiles, self evaluations, training
                                assignments, and the recommendations based on the
                                player evaluation metrics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Following this, we made improvements on how the recommendations
                                for players were produced and presented.
                                A stance diagram generator, an algorithm to determine ball
                                placement, and a structure that could support the thousands of
                                unique insights about different aspects of the evaluations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next was the booking system, payment integration through swish.
                                And a solid financial structure, which we could build on for
                                reporting and bookkeeping.

                                involved a decent amount of improving tooling and processes
                                for testing, to achieve velocity. Helping with planning and
                                strategy, as well as moving away from centering around
                                Swedish SSN and adapting the system for multiple languages.

                                I also made a large effort to be an evangelist for working
                                with a holistic product-oriented mindset instead of the
                                established project-oriented one. Additionally, I wanted to
                                work in a way that would nudge people towards being more
                                engaged across teams, caring about the platform as a whole,
                                and sharing in the responsibilities. I did this because I
                                saw that we could reach large improvements by just getting
                                a lot of people to step up just a little.

                                This period of my career was filled to the brim with new and
                                exciting experiences, together with the small, tight-knit
                                group that was left—both engineering and entrepreneurial
                                challenges.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We were first tasked with constructing support for
                                the flow that would allow the Smspark user base to migrate
                                over to Easypark, as well as the mechanisms that would be
                                central to migrating all the parking zones over to Easypark's
                                roster.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All the while, we continued to be on-call and maintain the
                                Smspark operations and infrastructure, periodically scaling
                                down to limit costs as the platform cooled down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also got to make some contributions to the Easypark
                                products by building some features that Smspark supported
                                into their ecosystem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the platform was ready to be decommissioned, we had a
                                significant task in archiving the system and cleaning out
                                all data that was no longer essential. After which we had
                                the strange and bittersweet experience of destroying a
                                service that had once handled over 1,600,000 transactions per month.

                                At the end of the summer in 2019, Smspark employees were
                                informed that the company had been acquired after a long
                                process of trying to sell. The new owners were one of our
                                biggest competitors, Easypark. For a number of reasons, this
                                announcement did not land as well as it could have. This led
                                large portions of the tech staff, including myself, to
                                submit our resignation. Almost all the resigning
                                staff were relieved of their duties on the day they
                                resigned; I was one of the exceptions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my 3-month notice period, I got wind that Easypark
                                would be searching for consultants who could keep the
                                platform running. That is where another colleague who was
                                still around decided to float the idea of us taking on the
                                challenge instead of getting a third party in who would
                                need to be brought up to speed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is where I founded West Coast Dev, and began my career
                                as a consultant.

                                At Inteleon, I really got to start my journey towards the
                                DevOps lifestyle. I was fortunate enough to get to work
                                alongside some very talented and forward-thinking people.
                                The bosses, the teammates, coaches, and other people
                                in the organization all contributed to teaching me so many
                                new things and helping me improve both my career and life
                                in general.
                            </p>

                                Some of the trails that we walked down were: breaking apart
                                a monolith and migrating to service-oriented architecture,
                                converting the legacy PHP system to Golang-based services,
                                and moving from static servers with little scalability to container-orchestrated
                                infrastructure. We did not get to the end of
                                all of these trails, but we made some good headway and
                                learned a lot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was also very rewarding to get to work on a platform
                                that directly impacted so many users daily. In a month,
                                we had upwards of 1.6M unique parking
                                transactions, as well as a large-scale billing mechanism
                                that serviced all these user transactions.

                                Once again I was back to working with my friends at what was
                                formerly @Lan/WebDoc. I joined under permanent employment as
                                one of the software engineers. We all worked more or less
                                full-stack, helping each other out.
                                My responsibilities were, among other things, developing new
                                features in projects, demoing features, and handling final
                                integration and merge before regression testing began.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this stint, I also got to be a part of a big shift in
                                the way that the software was developed. For example, the
                                early parts of a continuous integration pipeline were
                                established, and we started working a lot more with
                                reliable, repeatable testing.

                                In the early parts of 2014, I started working with Roofia
                                again part-time alongside my studies. We were planning
                                on rebuilding a lot of what had been built so far and
                                aiming for the system to work well on iPads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this time, I learned a lot about working with a
                                customer directly. I also learned the hard way when, why,
                                and how I should pull out of a partnership. Because as an
                                inexperienced, ambitious, full-time student, I made a lot of
                                mistakes. Most harmfully for both the customer and me,
                                I failed to communicate that I was incapable of meeting
                                their needs and nearing burnout, almost flunking out
                                at the end.

                                While studying, I wanted to earn some extra money during
                                the summers, and I was lucky enough that @Lan had some work
                                for me to do.

                                manning the support hotline while the regular team was on
                                vacation.
                                The development varied from bug-squashing to
                                experimental feature development in WebDoc and Roofnet.

                                we got to collaborate with local companies and, of course,
                                our thesis.

                                who was laying the groundwork for his future success.
                                I was doing some very basic and questionable systems and
                                web development, mostly learning by doing since I was
                                extremely new to the field.

                                I also got to do some operations in the context of the web
                                hotel side of the business, mostly messing around with
                                settings in Apache and a CMS system called Arctic Fox.

                                Most notably I was building a work management system for a
                                roof maintenance franchise called Roofia. I realized rather
                                quickly that I would benefit from a base in formal
                                education.
