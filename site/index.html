                <p>
                    I am a software developer from western Sweden. I started my career
                    working with my cousin in 2011 and have since then developed a
                    love for developing web-based SaaS platforms. I like
                    to think about the work that I do in terms of how it relates to
                    the larger context that I am contributing to. I feel that my best
                    work is done when I have a good understanding of who I am building
                    things for and what they are trying to achieve. As a consequence,
                    I am also a strong proponent for helping out wherever it is most
                    needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy running, cooking, hiking, fishing, and camping. I love to
                    ski downhill and play golf. I have also been exploring my interest
                    in rock climbing, surfing, and sailing. In 2018, I got a skipper
                    certification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a very small town not too far from
                    Gothenburg and spent a few of my teenage years in Melbourne,
                    Australia. After high school, I got my first job as a
                    software engineer, but after a year, I decided that I should
                    probably get an education. So I moved to Karlskrona to
                    study. When I was finished there, I moved to Gothenburg to
                    get started with my career.

                                I am currently working in a setting that I have been
                                dreaming about for a long time: getting to be a part of the
                                initial stages of something that I think can be a great
                                product—a true startup. Helping a successful golf coach
                                organization take a leap into tech development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are laying the groundwork for and testing the viability
                                of a new platform that aims to help golf coaches reach new
                                heights in their trade, working with a trailblazer in golf
                                coaching to reach even further with his individualized
                                approach to developing a golfer's game and swing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are really in the business development phase and at
                                the same time developing the tech that we hope will
                                validate the idea. The challenge of proving a concept as
                                well as finding market fit and developing a lasting
                                product all at the same time—it is, to say the least, a
                                varied and exciting challenge.

                                Back at WebDoc again! After 4+ years away, I got to come
                                back and work with my old friends again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This time the name of the game was helping my team adapt the
                                platform to meet the needs of the Norwegian market. This
                                involved a decent amount of improving tooling and processes
                                for testing, to achieve velocity. Helping with planning and
                                strategy, as well as moving away from centering around
                                Swedish SSN and adapting the system for multiple languages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also made a large effort to be an evangelist for working
                                with a holistic product-oriented mindset instead of the
                                established project-oriented one. Additionally, I wanted to
                                work in a way that would nudge people towards being more
                                engaged across teams, caring about the platform as a whole,
                                and sharing in the responsibilities. I did this because I
                                saw that we could reach large improvements by just getting
                                a lot of people to step up just a little.

                                exciting experiences, together with the small, tight-knit
                                group that was left—both engineering and entrepreneurial
                                challenges.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We were first tasked with constructing support for
                                the flow that would allow the Smspark user base to migrate
                                over to Easypark, as well as the mechanisms that would be
                                central to migrating all the parking zones over to Easypark's
                                roster.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All the while, we continued to be on-call and maintain the
                                Smspark operations and infrastructure, periodically scaling
                                down to limit costs as the platform cooled down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also got to make some contributions to the Easypark
                                products by building some features that Smspark supported
                                into their ecosystem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the platform was ready to be decommissioned, we had a
                                significant task in archiving the system and cleaning out
                                all data that was no longer essential. After which we had
                                the strange and bittersweet experience of destroying a
                                service that had once handled over 1,600,000 transactions per month.

                                At the end of the summer in 2019, Smspark employees were
                                informed that the company had been acquired after a long
                                process of trying to sell. The new owners were one of our
                                biggest competitors, Easypark. For a number of reasons, this
                                announcement did not land as well as it could have. This led
                                large portions of the tech staff, including myself, to
                                submit our resignation. Almost all the resigning
                                staff were relieved of their duties on the day they
                                resigned; I was one of the exceptions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my 3-month notice period, I got wind that Easypark
                                would be searching for consultants who could keep the
                                platform running. That is where another colleague who was
                                still around decided to float the idea of us taking on the
                                challenge instead of getting a third party in who would
                                need to be brought up to speed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is where I founded West Coast Dev, and began my career
                                as a consultant.

                                At Inteleon, I really got to start my journey towards the
                                DevOps lifestyle. I was fortunate enough to get to work
                                alongside some very talented and forward-thinking people.
                                The bosses, the teammates, coaches, and other people
                                in the organization all contributed to teaching me so many
                                new things and helping me improve both my career and life
                                in general.

                                Some of the trails that we walked down were: breaking apart
                                a monolith and migrating to service-oriented architecture,
                                converting the legacy PHP system to Golang-based services,
                                and moving from static servers with little scalability to container-orchestrated
                                infrastructure. We did not get to the end of
                                all of these trails, but we made some good headway and
                                learned a lot.
                            </p>

                                It was also very rewarding to get to work on a platform
                                that directly impacted so many users daily. In a month,
                                we had upwards of 1.6M unique parking
                                transactions, as well as a large-scale billing mechanism
                                that serviced all these user transactions.

                                Once again I was back to working with my friends at what was
                                formerly @Lan/WebDoc. I joined under permanent employment as
                                one of the software engineers. We all worked more or less
                                full-stack, helping each other out.
                                My responsibilities were, among other things, developing new
                                features in projects, demoing features, and handling final
                                integration and merge before regression testing began.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this stint, I also got to be a part of a big shift in
                                the way that the software was developed. For example, the
                                early parts of a continuous integration pipeline were
                                established, and we started working a lot more with
                                reliable, repeatable testing.

                                In the early parts of 2014, I started working with Roofia
                                again part-time alongside my studies. We were planning
                                on rebuilding a lot of what had been built so far and
                                aiming for the system to work well on iPads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this time, I learned a lot about working with a
                                customer directly. I also learned the hard way when, why,
                                and how I should pull out of a partnership. Because as an
                                inexperienced, ambitious, full-time student, I made a lot of
                                mistakes. Most harmfully for both the customer and me,
                                I failed to communicate that I was incapable of meeting
                                their needs and nearing burnout, almost flunking out
                                at the end.

                                While studying, I wanted to earn some extra money during
                                the summers, and I was lucky enough that @Lan had some work
                                for me to do.

                                My work mainly consisted of non-critical development and
                                manning the support hotline while the regular team was on
                                vacation.
                                The development varied from bug-squashing to
                                experimental feature development in WebDoc and Roofnet.

                                program had a web profile and focused a lot more on
                                practical learning than on, for example, mathematics, as traditional
                                computer science programs would.

                                healthy dose of courses aimed at specializing in web-based
                                technologies. Finishing off with project-based courses where
                                we got to collaborate with local companies and, of course,
                                our thesis.

                                who was laying the groundwork for his future success.
                                I was doing some very basic and questionable systems and
                                web development, mostly learning by doing since I was
                                extremely new to the field.

                                I also got to do some operations in the context of the web
                                hotel side of the business, mostly messing around with
                                settings in Apache and a CMS system called Arctic Fox.

                                Most notably I was building a work management system for a
                                roof maintenance franchise called Roofia. I realized rather
                                quickly that I would benefit from a base in formal
                                education.
