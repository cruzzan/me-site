            <p>
              I am a software developer from western Sweden. I started my career
              working with my cousin in 2011, and have since then developed a
              love for working with developing web based SaaS platforms. I like
              to think about the work that I do in terms of how they relate to
              the larger context that I am contributing to. I feel that my best
              work is done when I have a good understanding of who I am building
              things for, and what they are trying to achieve. As a consequence
              I am also a strong proponent for helping out wherever it is most
              needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy running, cooking, hiking, fishing and camping. I love to
              ski downhill and play golf. I have also been exploring my interest
              in rock climbing, surfing and sailing. In 2018 I got a skipper
              certification.
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up in a very small town not too far from
              Gothenburg and spent a few of my teenage years in Melbourne,
              Australia. After high school I got my first job as a
              software engineer but after a year I decided that I should
              probably get an education. So I moved to Karlskrona to
              study. When I was finished there I moved to Gothenburg to
              get started with my career.

                    I am currently working in a setting that I have been
                    dreaming about, for a long time. Getting to be a part of the
                    initial stages of something that I think can be a great
                    product. A true start-up. Helping a successful golf coach
                    organization take a leap into tech development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are laying the groundwork for, and testing the viability
                    of a new platform that aims to help golf coaches reach new
                    heights in their trade. Working with a trailblazer in golf
                    coaching to reach even further with his individualized
                    approach to developing a golfers game and swing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are really in the business development phase and at
                    the same time developing the tech that we hope, will
                    validate the idea. The challenge of proofing a concept as
                    well as finding market fit, and developing a lasting
                    product, all at the same time. It is to say the least a
                    varying, and exciting challenge.

                    Back at WebDoc again! After 4+ years away, I got to come
                    back and work with my old friends again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This time the name of the game was helping my team adapt the
                    platform to meet the needs of the Norwegian market. This
                    involved a decent amount of improving tooling and processes
                    for testing, to achieve velocity. Helping with planning and
                    strategy, as well as moving away from centering around
                    Swedish SSN and adapting the system for multiple languages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also made a large effort to be an evangelist for working
                    in with a holistic product oriented mindset, instead of the
                    established project oriented one. Additionally, I wanted to
                    work in a way that would nudge people towards being more
                    engaged across teams, caring about the platform as a whole
                    and sharing in the responsibilities. I did this because I
                    saw that we could reach large improvements by just getting a
                    lot of people to step up, just a little.

                  <p>
                    This period of my career was filled to the brim with new and
                    exiting experience, together with the small, tight-knit
                    group that was left. Both engineering and entrepreneurial
                    challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We were, first off, tasked with constructing support for
                    the flow that would allow the Smspark user base to migrate
                    over to Easypark. As well as the mechanisms that would be
                    central to migrating all the parking zones over to Easyparks
                    roster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All the while we continued to be on-call and maintaining the
                    Smspark operations and infrastructure. Periodically scaling
                    down to limit costs as the platform cooled down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also got to make some contributions to the Easypark
                    products by building some features that Smspark supported
                    into their eco-system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once the platform was ready to be decommissioned we had a
                    significant task in archiving the system and cleaning out
                    all data that was not essential anymore. After which we had
                    the strange and bitter/sweet experience of destroying a
                    service that had once handled +1,600,000 transactions/month.

                    At the end of the summer in 2019 Smspark employees were
                    informed that the company had been acquired, after a long
                    process of trying to sell. The new owners were one of our
                    biggest competitors, Easypark. For a number of reasons, this
                    announcement did not land as well as it could have. This led
                    to large portions of the tech-staff, including myself, to
                    leaving our notice of resignation. Almost all the resigning
                    staff were relieved of their duties on the day that they
                    resigned, I was one of the exceptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During my 3-month notice period, I got wind that Easypark
                    would be searching for consultants that could keep the
                    platform running. That is where another colleague, who was
                    still around, decided to float the idea of us taking on the
                    challenge. Instead of getting a third party in, who would
                    need to be brought up to speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is where I founded West Coast Dev, and began my career
                    as a consultant.

                    DevOps lifestyle. I was fortunate enough to get to work
                    alongside some very talented and forward-thinking people.
                    The bosses, the teammates, coaches and other people
                    in the organization all contributed to teaching me so many
                    new things and helping me improve both my career and my life
                    in general.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the trails that we walked down were; breaking apart
                    a monolith, and migrating to service oriented architecture.
                    Converting the legacy Php system to Golang based services.
                    Static servers with little scalability to container
                    orchestrated infrastructure. We did not get to the end of
                    all of these trails, but we made some good headway and
                    learned a lot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was also very rewarding to get to work on a platform
                    that directly impacted so many users, daily. In a month
                    we had upwards or more than unique 1.6M parking
                    transactions. As well as a large scale billing mechanism
                    that serviced all these user transactions.

                    Once again I was back to working with my friends at what was
                    formerly @Lan/WebDoc. I joined under permanent employment as
                    one of the software engineers. We all worked more or less
                    fullstack helping each other out.
                    My responsibilities were, among other things, developing new
                    features in projects, demoing features and handling final
                    integration and merge before the regression testing begins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During this stint I also got to be a part in a big shift in
                    the way that the software was developed. For example the
                    early parts of a continuous integration pipeline were
                    established, and we started working a lot more with
                    reliable, repeatable testing.

                  <p>
                    In the early parts of 2014 I started working with Roofia
                    again, part-time, alongside my studies. We were planning
                    on rebuilding a lot of what had been built so far, and
                    aiming for the system to work well on iPads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During this time I learned a lot about working with a
                    customer directly. I also learned the hard way, when, why
                    and how, I should pull out of a partnership. Because, as an
                    inexperienced, ambitious, full time student, I made a lot of
                    mistakes. Most harmfully for both the customer and me,
                    I failed to communicate that I was incapable of meeting
                    their needs and nearing burn-out, and almost flunking out,
                    at the end.

                    While studying I wanted to earn some extra money during
                    the summers, and I was lucky enough that @Lan had some work
                    for me to do during those summers.

                    My work mainly consisted of non-critical development and
                    manning the support hot-line while the regular team were on
                    vacation.
                    The development would vary from bug-squashing to
                    experimental feature development in WebDoc and Roofnet.

                    A 3 year bachelors program in software engineering. The

                    practical learning than on for example maths, as traditional

                    healthy dose of courses aimed at specializing in web based
                    technologies. Finishing off with project based courses where
                    we got to collaborate with local companies and, of course,
                    our thesis.

                    This was my first job in development, taken in by my cousin,
                    who was laying the groundwork for his future success.
                    I was doing some very basic and questionable systems- and
                    web- development. Mostly learning by doing, since I was
                    extremely new to the field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also got to do some operations, in the context of the web
                    hotel side of the business. Mostly messing around with
                    settings in Apache and a CMS system called Arctic fox.

                    Most notably I was building a work management system for a
                    roof maintenance franchise called Roofia. I realized rather
                    quickly that I would benefit from a base in formal
                    education.
